			<p> It’s now 20 years into the Willennium, and how has our reigning Fresh Prince fared since the 1990s? On the Oscars
				front, Will Smith notched two Best Actor nominations for 2001’s Ali, and then for The Pursuit of Happyness in 2006. He’s
				adapted two genre literary classics into blockbusters (I Am Legend and I, Robot), and he was there during the 2008’s</p>
			<p>
				summer of superheroes with Hancock, which released one month after Iron Man and one before The Dark Knight and Hellboy II.
				Of course, that’s not to say Smith was slacking in the ’90s (though if he was, certainly no one would have noticed),
				which saw a diversified pop culture portfolio that includes a beloved TV show at the beginning of the decade, and a slew
				of hip-hop crossover hits at the end. Sandwiched in between were films like Independence Day, which at the time felt
				like the biggest movie event ever, and Men in Black, which got its first Smith-less sequel in 2019.</p>
			<p>
				But on the subject of sequels that didn’t disappoint, and even surprised: Bad Boys For Life, which reunited Smith with Martin
				Lawrence for some throwback buddy action. Its January release seemed like a kiss of death, yet the movie has drawn some
				of the best reviews of both stars’ careers. See where it places as we rank the best Will Smith movies (and the worst)
				by Tomatometer!
